# Shenghai's Code for daily work
## Please note that the "Fighting Epidemics" game is in another branch!!! Select from the "branch" option!
### The code base is jointly created by Shen Shenghai and Wu Zhaoming from SDU-ANU College of Shandong University, in order to better display the learned programming knowledge.
#### As an undergraduate program aligned to the Australian National University's 'Quantitative Biology' Master's program, Shen studied a number of classes involving statistics and data science in their undergraduate studies. And a range of cross-disciplinary research has been done.
#### However, Shen's programming skills are not well demonstrated in the corresponding material. So he created this open access project to showcase some of the code scripts used in his daily course work and research projects.
* It is worth noting that some code data that cannot be made public (unpublished or Shen has no right to share) cannot be uploaded here in time. Thesecan be obtained by contacting Shen if required (shenghaishen@mail.sdu.edu.cn).
